          The project was to create a logo that represents the core value of the
          company which is providing end-to-end business services to the
          clients. <br />
          <br />
          The services are offered to one consultant until they achieve the
          business goals.
          <br />
          <br /> We came up with the idea of the visual to represent two persons
          connected seamlessly that look like two persons are holding hands in
          an infinity symbol.
