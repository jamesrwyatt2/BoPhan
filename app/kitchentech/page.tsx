          For more than two decades, Connie Charuvastr and her late husband,
          Chanchai Charuvastr had relentlessly developed and built an empire of
          luxury products in the Home, Furniture, and Interior area. For this
          project,
          <br />
          <br /> I have worked directly with the owner, created from the CMS
          with the capability of templating and content management system to
          maintain the content on the site to be up-to-date based on the new
          kitchen model that came out every year. <br />
