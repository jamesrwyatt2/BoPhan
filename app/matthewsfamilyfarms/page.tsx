          <br />
          This project was the first logo design I got to work on. Matthews is
          the name of the owner of the USA local produce products. <br />
          <br />
          He wanted the logo to represent the farmers.
          <br />
          <br />
          So we came up with the farm truck shape when looking from the front of
          the vehicle, along with his choice of colors and combination of the
          simple and easy-to-read text's font.
