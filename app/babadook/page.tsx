          This school project is a poster design subject. The assignment was to
          create one poster from any movie by choice. <br />
          <br />
          <br />I picked a horror movie of course! I have so much fun with the
          design. The movie is about a family of two the mother and the child (I
          think they have something going on with their mental health).
          <br /> <br />
          The two have created a monster within their imaginary world but it was
          so intense until the monster entered their world... I mean (spoiler
          alert ) in the end it was them who did it to themself. I designed the
          big old wooden closet half open you can't see anything inside but the
          red claw mark on the outside ( Yes the monster has claws! ).
          <br />
          <br />I used my favorite 3D program called Bender (It is free and it's
          good! ) I do all the modeling and texture mapping and render it out
          with an internal render engine ( Back in 2014 it's pretty impressive
          ).
          <br />
          <br /> The class instructor loves the design ( He's the artist who
          created a "Saw" the movies so I am very happy with his feedback).
